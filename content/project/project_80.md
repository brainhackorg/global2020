Goal is to create a resource for early career researchers in Turkey to start public sharing data. We would be compiling examples for applications to ethical committees, examples of language in informed consent, list of universities and ethical committees that have approved public data sharing, resources and links to relevant regulations.\r\nTo start we are going to learn and brainstorm with the experts in the field of data  privacy and sharing. \r\nWe know that [Open Brain Consent](https://open-brain-consent.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) has done tremendous job on opening up the practices for data collection for ethical committees. There is  a Turkish Translation available for [data user agreement](https://github.com/con/open-brain-consent/blob/a8070f4d09134b1a130d80269e13007f154e1a1b/docs/source/gdpr/i18n/data_user_agreement.tr.rst) and [ultimate GDPR](https://github.com/con/open-brain-consent/blob/a8070f4d09134b1a130d80269e13007f154e1a1b/docs/source/gdpr/i18n/ultimate_gdpr.tr.rst) which would be useful to anyone who needs them. Establishing applicable practices providing local resources forming a consensus on language, style necessary tools and  establishing the routes are also necessary for applicable solutions.
