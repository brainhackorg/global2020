  "project_description": "\r\nThe aim of this project is to restart the development of [physiopy/phys2denoise](https://github.com/physiopy/phys2denoise), an automated pipeline to create BIDS-formatted physiological regressors for neuroimaging denoising.\r\nIn practice, some folks might like to collect physiological recordings (e.g. pulse, chest expansion, % of gasses breathed out, skin conductance, ...) while performing fMRI (_fun MRI_) experiments (or any other technique for which it's relevant to consider physiological data). Those same folks might want to use the data they collected to implement impressive preprocessing pipelines and clean MRI data from physiological artefacts. If the data get BIDSified, for instance using [physiopy/phys2bids](https://github.com/physiopy/phys2bids), we can set up a pipeline that read such data and prepares all of the regressors that might be used in that same preprocessing pipeline (e.g. RETROICOR, RVT, RV, CRF, ...).\r\nDuring the BHD week, we'll re-draft and code the skeleton of the pipeline, and merge the contributions that have been proposed during the OHBM Hackhathon. We'll also start drafting the documentation of the repository (explaining all those funny acronyms reported above), and write a couple of tests. Later in the week we'll do some user testing too, and if we'll have time, start working on a proposal to make `fMRIprep` ready files - in order to work toward a possible integration.\r\nIf there is an arts-and-crafts oriented person, we are in need of logo!\r\n\r\n**Moreover**:\r\n- *no limits in the number of participants*, although we'll work in parallel in smaller teams should we become too many or the task requires it.\r\n- *we ac(q)knowledge (inside joke) all contributions* using a Turing-way-inspired, all-contributors based system.\r\n- *we have a (quite extensive) documentation for contributors* in [physiopy/phys2bids](https://github.com/physiopy/phys2bids), like:\r\n    - [Contributing to phys2bids](https://phys2bids.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing.html)\r\n    - [Developer installation](https://phys2bids.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing.html#linux-and-mac-developer-installation)\r\n    - [**Contributor guide**](https://phys2bids.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributorfile.html)\r\n    - [**Code of Conduct**](https://phys2bids.readthedocs.io/en/latest/conduct.html)\r\n    - [Developer calls calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=amoycDQ1MTdhMWdpaHNuNzlnOW1ucHJkMjRAZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ)\r\n\r\n**Data to use:**\r\n<!-- If your project uses data, add a short description of the data and a link to its source. -->\r\nLater during the week, we _might_ use some of the data we have in [OSF](https://osf.io/3txqr/).

To submit a project, you need to be an attendee to one of the Brainhack Global 2020 events listed on the [Brainhack Global 2020 webpage](https://brainhack.org/global2020/events/). Please, register for the event that is most suitable to your location, time zone, interest, and/or project prior to submitting one. Thank you!\r\n\r\nWe have prepared a checklist to help with your project submission. Here is how to proceed:\r\n\r\nBefore filling in any part please check items in the checklist below as you go through them.\r\nOnce you are done (at least all 'required' items must be provided), please delete the \"Guidelines\" section, submit your issue and add a comment saying 'Hi @Brainhack-Global/project-monitors: my project is ready!'\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\nAfter the issue is submitted, we will assign a 'project monitor' from the event location that you are registered with to review your submission.
