  "project_description": "\r\n\r\n[**eeg-notebooks**](https://github.com/NeuroTechX/eeg-notebooks) is a Python library that allows you to run cognitive neuroscience experiments with a simple mobile EEG device and laptop computer. We like to think of and talk about this as ***\"democratizing the cognitive neuroscience experiment\"***, because it makes it possible to achieve for a few hundred bucks what traditionally has only been possible in dedicated research labs with quadruple figure price tags.\r\n\r\n*Examples:*\r\n\r\nLaunch experiment and device selection prompt with the stand-alone command line interface:\r\n```bash\r\neegnb runexp -ip \r\n```\r\n\r\nRun a visual N170 (faces vs. houses) RSVP EEG experiment via the Python API:\r\n```python\r\nfrom eegnb.experiments.visual_n170 import n170   # choose and import the experiment to run from a wide selection\r\nfrom eegnb.devices.eeg import EEG                # import and initialize an EEG object that deals with \r\neeg_device = EEG(device='muse2016')              # ...connecting to and streaming from your device\r\nn170.present(duration=300, eeg=eeg_device,       # launch the experiment (psychopy visual stimulus presentation), \r\n                     save_fn='my170data.csv')    # ...and write EEG data and experiment triggers to file\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor more examples, check out the sphinx [examples gallery](https://neurotechx.github.io/eeg-notebooks/experiments/all_examples.html). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Data to use:**\r\n<!-- If your project uses data, add a short description of the data and a link to its source. -->\r\n\r\n1. The eeg-notebooks repo has multiple example datasets for several EEG experiments. We are very interested in contributions that present compelling new analyses of these data in the examples documentation\r\n\r\n2. Collect your own data! We are compiling a large database of user-contributed EEG data, collected using the eeg-notebooks visual and auditory experiments. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Link to project repository/sources:**\r\nhttps://github.com/NeuroTechX/eeg-notebooks\r\nDocs page: https://neurotechx.github.io/eeg-notebooks\r\n\r\n\r\n**Goals for Brainhack Global 2020:**\r\n<!-- Add a list of milestones or deliverables that you expect to achieve during the event. Try to provide goals of varying complexity for contributors with different sets of skills. -->\r\n\r\nAt BHG 2020 we are primarily looking for contributions in the following areas\r\n\r\n- Extend and fill gaps in the documentation\r\n- New analyses of existing data (ERPs, SSVEPs)\r\n- Add new experiments in PsychoPy\r\n- Generate EEG/ERP recordings for our database\r\n- Add support for new devices\r\n- Test support for existing devices\r\n\r\nWe're also all ears for any cool new additional functionality ideas. \r\n\r\nImportant point: **You don't need an EEG device available to join us and make contributions**. \r\n\r\nFor example, there's plenty of important work to be done that is straight-up MNE, and/or Scikit-Learn, and/or Psychopy. \r\n\r\nYou can contribute to data collection and device testing if you have access to one or more of the following: Muse2016,  Muse2, MuseS, OpenBCI Ganglion, OpenBCI Cyton, G.Tec Unicorn, BrainBit, Neurosity Notion 1, Neurosity Notion 2. See the eeg-notebooks documentation for more info. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Good first issues:**\r\n<!-- Add a list of tasks to help new contributors find easy gateways into open source projects. -->\r\n\r\n1. Test installation, report any bugs + observations for improvement in docs (more [here](https://github.com/NeuroTechX/eeg-notebooks/issues/27) )\r\n\r\n2.

To submit a project, you need to be an attendee to one of the Brainhack Global 2020 events listed on the [Brainhack Global 2020 webpage](https://brainhack.org/global2020/events/). Please, register for the event that is most suitable to your location, time zone, interest, and/or project prior to submitting one. Thank you!\r\n\r\nWe have prepared a checklist to help with your project submission. Here is how to proceed:\r\n\r\nBefore filling in any part please check items in the checklist below as you go through them.\r\nOnce you are done (at least all 'required' items must be provided), please delete the \"Guidelines\" section, submit your issue and add a comment saying 'Hi @Brainhack-Global/project-monitors: my project is ready!'\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\nAfter the issue is submitted, we will assign a 'project monitor' from the event location that you are registered with to review your submission. Once the submission is approved by the 'project monitor', they will add the label 'Project is ready' and it will appear on [Brainhack Global 2020 Projects](https://brainhack.org/global2020/projects) page with a separate project dedicated webpage. \r\n\r\nNote that you can always update your issue which will also change your page on the website accordingly.\r\n\r\nIf at any time you need help from us or anything is unclear, please add a comment and ping your project monitor.

We ask you to include at least one non-coding skill. Use the issue labels for this purpose.\r\n<!-- - [x] Chat channel: A link to a chat channel that will be used during the Brainhack Global 2020 event. This can be an existing channel or a new one. We recommend using the [Brainhack space on Mattermost](https://mattermost.brainhack.org/).-->\r\n<!-- [ ] Video channel: A link to a video channel that will be used during the Brainhack Global 2020 Brainhack. This can be an existing channel or a new one. For instance a [Jitsi meet room](https://meet.jit.si/). **Please, do not make the video channel public in here**: post a message in your chat channel and pin it so that it remains private, you do not get undesired content, and contributors can still have access to it..-->\r\n\r\nOptionally, you can also include information about:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Number of participants required.\r\n- [ ] Twitter-sized summary of your project pitch.\r\n- [x] Provide an image of your project for the Brainhack Global 2020 website. \r\n<!-- You can put an image anywhere in this issue and it will be used to build your project page on the website. -->\r\n\r\nWe would like to think about how you will credit and onboard new members to your project.
