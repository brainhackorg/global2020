  "project_description": " \r\n\r\n_AIM_\r\n\r\nThe aim of the project is to implement an algorithm for fast and robust fitting of complex microstructure imaging methods, such as the soma and neurite density imaging (SANDI), using the accelerated microstructure imaging via convex optimization (AMICO) framework.  \r\n  \r\n_What is SANDI?_\r\n\r\nSANDI (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.116835) is a novel imaging technique based on diffusion MRI and biophysical modelling, designed to provide maps of MR indices of apparent soma density and size, as well as apparent neurite density. As such, SANDI is of interest for studies involving the characterization of brain cytoarchitectonics in a wide range of conditions: e.g., brain development, aging, plasticity, neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration, and more. \r\n\r\n_What is AMICO?_\r\n\r\nThe AMICO framework (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2014.10.026) offers the possibility to re-formulates virtually any microstructure imaging model as convenient linear systems which, then, can be efficiently solved using very fast algorithms. To date, it has been successfully employed with other models, such as NODDI and ActiveAx. We will implement an AMICO version of SANDI building upon the code publicly available at https://github.com/daducci/AMICO\r\n\r\n_Why SANDI-AMICO_\r\n\r\nThe fitting of the SANDI model originally proposed is based on machine learning regression, which provides ultra-fast model parameters estimation but requires the careful design of both the training strategy and the machine learning model.  \r\nThe AMICO framework can overcome these issues and provide the scientific community with a more agnostic algorithm for the fast and robust estimation of SANDI indices.  \r\n \r\n \r\n**Data to use:**  \r\nWe will use unpublished data collected at high field and high diffusion gradient strength on the mouse brain. Since it is unpublished, the data will be made available privately by the project leader.  \r\n \r\n**Link to project repository/sources:** \r\nhttps://github.com/daducci/AMICO \r\nPalombo, Marco, et al. \"SANDI: a compartment-based model for non-invasive apparent soma and neurite imaging by diffusion MRI.\" NeuroImage (2020): 116835.

(https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2014.10.026)\r\n \r\n**Goals for Brainhack Global 2020:**\r\nDeliverable 1: stable version of SANDI-AMICO; \r\nDeliverable 2: tested version of SANDI-AMICO on one suitable dataset; \r\n \r\n**Good first issues:** \r\n \r\n1. Implementing data and protocol loader: read NIFTI file; read b values and directions; check data consistency; separate data in shells and average across directions; \r\n2. Implementing database generator: define functions to generate response functions to be used in the AMICO linear system according to the SANDI model and the Gaussian Phase Distribution approximation; \r\n3. Implementing the optimizer: define the objective function, setup the optimizer, perform the voxelwise fitting; \r\n4. Implementing the result writer: save the SANDI maps in NIFTI format, keeping the correct header file;  \r\n5. Test performances: generate known ground-truth conditions using analytical simulations and different noise characteristics (e.g. Gaussian, Gaussian + floor; Rician); \r\n6. Write up an initial tutorial on the wiki page of the AMICO repository. \r\n \r\n**Skills:**\r\nPython programming; \r\nFamiliar with DWI data processing (e.g. NIFTI/DICOM format, diffusion-weighted MRI protocols etc.);\r\nBasic understanding on inverse linear problems (least square method, common regularization techniques, etc.);\r\n \r\n**Tools/Software/Methods to Use:** \r\nPython 3, AMICO (pip install dmri-amico), Camino, visual studio code or spider or jupyter.\r\n<!-- Add a list of tools/software/methods that are advised to be installed/reviewed ahead of the event to gain a bit of time with the installation of the software, preparation of the environments or describing the methods that will be needed to contribute to this project.
