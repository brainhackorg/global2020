The lessons cover intro to neuroimaging (using BIDS), pybids, downloading public data, working with fMRI data in python (nibabel and nilearn) as well as diffusion MRI analysis. We have previously taught these lesson's as part of BrainHack Toronto and BrainHack Western and the lesson's have now been moved into the \"carpentries incubator\". Meaning that we are hoping that others might be interested in teaching or learning from this material soon! We are inviting others to check out the material during BrainHack global and give us some feedback! \r\n\r\n**Data to use:**\r\nDataset are described in individual lesson repo's.

To submit a project, you need to be an attendee to one of the Brainhack Global 2020 events listed on the [Brainhack Global 2020 webpage](https://brainhack.org/global2020/events/). Please, register for the event that is most suitable to your location, time zone, interest, and/or project prior to submitting one. Thank you!\r\n\r\nWe have prepared a checklist to help with your project submission. Here is how to proceed:\r\n\r\nBefore filling in any part please check items in the checklist below as you go through them.\r\nOnce you are done (at least all 'required' items must be provided), please delete the \"Guidelines\" section, submit your issue and add a comment saying 'Hi @Brainhack-Global/project-monitors: my project is ready!'\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\nAfter the issue is submitted, we will assign a 'project monitor' from the event location that you are registered with to review your submission. Once the submission is approved by the 'project monitor', they will add the label 'Project is ready' and it will appear on [Brainhack Global 2020 Projects](https://brainhack.org/global2020/projects) page with a separate project dedicated webpage. \r\n\r\nNote that you can always update your issue which will also change your page on the website accordingly.\r\n\r\nIf at any time you need help from us or anything is unclear, please add a comment and ping your project monitor.
