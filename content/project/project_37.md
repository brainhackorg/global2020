  "project_description": "\r\nThe aim of this project is to learn, comprehend and implement implement two types of task-based connectivity analyses for functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) data, namely generalized psycho-physiological interactions (gPPI) and Dynamic Causal Modelling (DCM). These approaches will be evaluated in fNIRS data collected in 4-month-old infants while they listened to forward and backward speech sentences during sleep. Coding will mostly be in MATLAB (similar to the main programs for fNIRS data analysis), although implementation in Python can be explored. \r\n\r\n**Data to use:**\r\n<!-- If your project uses data, add a short description of the data and a link to its source. -->\r\nDatasets to work with will be available in project's GitHub repo (see next).\r\n\r\n**Link to project repository/sources:**\r\nhttps://github.com/borjablanco/BHDonostia_2020_fNIRS\r\n\r\n**Goals for Brainhack Global 2020:**\r\n<!-- Add a list of milestones or deliverables that you expect to achieve during the event. Try to provide goals of varying complexity for contributors with different sets of skills. -->\r\nThe goals of the project will be split into two different parts and days.\r\nDays 1-3:\r\n- Implement gPPI algorithms based on the current implementation using Parametric Empirical Bayes estimation available in SPM12, and adapt this formulation to deal with the fNIRS data structure. Moreover, alternative implementation of the deconvolution algorithm based on stability selection will be explored also based on current code available in Matlab. Milestone: Compute gPPI at the channel-level and global-level for several datasets. \r\n\r\nDays 4 and 5:\r\n- Learn and understand the implementation of DCM for fNIRS available in SPM12 (see chapter 46 of SPM12 manual, and related articles). \r\n- Using the gPPI results, formulate and implement different models within the DCM framework. \r\nMilestone: Perform DCM data analysis in several datasets and interpret the results.
