## Project submission

### Submission checklist

*Once the issue is submitted, please check items in this list as you add under ‘Additional project info’*

- [ ] Link to your project: could be a code repository, a shared document, etc. See [here](https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2020/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/handbooks/projects.md#link-to-project).
- [ ] Goals for Brainhack Donostia: describe what you want to achieve during this brainhack. See [here](https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2020/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/handbooks/projects.md#goals).
- [ ] Flesh out at least 2 “good first issues”: those are tasks that do not require any prior knowledge about your project, could be defined as issues in a GitHub repository, or in a shared document, cf. [here](https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2020/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/handbooks/projects.md#onboarding-2-good-first-issues).
- [ ] Skills: list skills that would be particularly suitable for your project. We ask you to include at least one non-coding skill, cf. [here](https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2020/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/handbooks/projects.md#onboarding-skills).
- [ ] Chat channel: A link to a chat channel that will be used during the OHBM Brainhack. This can be an existing channel or a new one. We recommend using the [Brainhack space on mattermost](https://mattermost.brainhack.org/), cf. [here](https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2020/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/handbooks/projects.md#chat).
- [ ] Video channel: A link to a video channel that will be used during the OHBM Brainhack. This can be an existing channel or a new one. For instance a [jitsi meet room](https://meet.jit.si/), cf. [here](https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2020/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/handbooks/projects.md#video-calls).

Optionally, you can also include information about:

- [ ] Number of participants, cf. [No limit. Anyone interested to learn can use the tutorials. There are multiple updates and fixes that need to happen, so multiple people can make contributions](https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2020/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/handbooks/projects.md#participant-capacity).
- [ ] Twitter-size summary of your project pitch, cf. [here](https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2020/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/handbooks/projects.md#twitter-size-summary-of-your-project-pitch).
- [ ] Provide an image of your project for the OHBM brainhack website.
- [ ] Project snippet for the OHBM Brainhack website, cf. [here](https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2020/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/handbooks/projects.md#project-snippet-for-the-ohbm-brainhack-website).

We would like to think about how you will credit and onboard new members to your project. We recommend reading references from [this section](https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2020/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/handbooks/projects.md#credit-and-onboarding). If you’d like to share your thoughts with future project participants, you can include information about:

- [ ] Specify how you will acknowledge contributions (e.g. listing members on a contributing page).
- [ ] Provide links to onboarding documents if you have some: [https://brainiak.org/tutorials/](https://brainiak.org/tutorials/)
