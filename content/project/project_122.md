  "project_description": "\r\n[Nipype](https://nipype.readthedocs.io) is a Python library that provides a uniform interface to existing neuroimaging software and facilitates interaction between these packages within a single workflow. It forms the basis of widely-used pipelines such as C-PAC and fMRIPrep.\r\n\r\n<!-- Nipype can be considered four separate components: 1) the workflow *engine*; 2) interfaces to specific tools; 3) pre-written workflows for use in larger workflows; 4) execution models to allow workflows to be run in different environments.\r\n\r\nIn Nipype 2, the\r\n-->\r\n\r\nPydra is a new workflow engine, written from scratch for Nipype 2. Pydra is reaching the maturity needed to justify upgrading workflows from Nipype 1, and it is time to build out the remainder of the ecosystem.\r\n\r\nIn this hackathon, we will focus on building tasks (interfaces) for neuroimaging tools that can be coordinated by Pydra, and workflows, sequences of tasks that meet real needs in neuroimaging.\r\n\r\nIf you're familiar with Nipype 1 and would like to flesh out a set of tasks (e.g., AFNI), we have a [tasks template](https://github.com/nipype/pydra-tasks-template) that you can use. If you would rather focus on a workflow, we encourage you to use the [niflow manager](https://github.com/niflows/niflow-manager/) to begin to create a workflow.\r\n\r\nPlease read the [contribution guide](https://github.com/nipype/pydra/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for tips on getting started and our policies on acknowledging contributions.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Data to use:** This project is not focused on any specific dataset, but participants are welcome to bring their own data or public data for testing and demonstrations. For MRI-based workflows, we can recommend [OpenNeuro ds000114](https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds000114) for different tasks and modalities.\r\n\r\n**Link to project repository/sources:** https://github.com/nipype/pydra\r\n\r\n**Goals for Brainhack Global 2020:**\r\n\r\n* New tasks giving Pydra users access to common neuroimaging functions\r\n* Example workflows that can be run independently or included in larger workflows\r\n* Improved documentation for new users\r\n  * Migration guide for users of other tools, including Nipype 1\r\n* Creating a dashboard for Pydra \r\n* Improving Slurm execution of the workflows \r\n* Datalad-aware data fetching and export\r\n* Creating Pydra command-line interface (CLI)\r\n* Dask integration\r\n\r\n**Good first issues:**\r\n\r\n1. [Running and improving tutorial](https://github.com/nipype/pydra/issues/277) \r\n2. [Improving Documentation](https://github.com/nipype/pydra/issues/278) \r\n3.
