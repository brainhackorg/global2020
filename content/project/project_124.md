  "project_description": "\r\n\r\nGender imbalance is a big problem in academic research, and it is even reflected in our citation behavior. Our goal is to assess the 'impact' of the [cleanBib](https://github.com/dalejn/cleanBib) tool, which was created to make researchers more aware of this problem. This tool can be used to assess the gender balance of authors in a reference list. Specifically, we want to find papers that cite the cleanBib [code](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3672109)/[paper](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-020-0658-y)/[preprint](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.03.894378), and see whether those citing papers have better gender balance in their reference lists than papers that do not. \r\n\r\nHere's a preliminary figure we made by manually searching for citing papers, up to October 2021. Our Goal 0 (see below) is to update this manual figure up to January 2021. Our Goals 1-5 are mean to automate this process. \r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/koudyk/cleanBibImpact/master/reports/figures/relative_gender_proportions_in_citing_papers.png).\r\n\r\n<!-- Add a brief description of the project. Try to include all the relevant information to answer the following questions:\r\nWhat are you doing, for who, and why;\r\nWhat makes your project special and exciting;\r\nA short example;\r\nHow to get started;\r\nWhere to find key resources; -->\r\n\r\n**Data to use:**\r\n<!-- If your project uses data, add a short description of the data and a link to its source. -->\r\n\r\n**Link to project repository/sources:**\r\n<!-- Add a link to the project\u2019s GitHub repo or website. -->\r\n[https://github.com/koudyk/cleanBibImpact](https://github.com/koudyk/cleanBibImpact)\r\n\r\n**Goals for Brainhack Global 2020:**\r\n<!-- Add a list of milestones or deliverables that you expect to achieve during the event. Try to provide goals of varying complexity for contributors with different sets of skills. -->\r\n\r\nFew skills needed:\r\n- [ ] **0. Manual inspection of citing papers' diversity statement**. As a first step, we're doing some manual data collection and visualization. We manually searched for papers that cite the code, paper, and/or preprint associated with cleanBib, and then compared their citations' gender diversity to the benchmarks reported in the [paper](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-020-0658-y). You can see our results in this [notebook](https://github.com/koudyk/cleanBibImpact/blob/master/src/visualization/visualize_manual_data.ipynb) as of October 2020. We're hoping to update these figures with citing papers up to January 2021. \r\n\r\nHere we'd benefit from skills in Python, working with APIs, and causality (we'll do these steps in order):\r\n- [ ] **1. List citing papers**. Automatically list papers that cite the code, paper, and/or preprint associated with cleanBib. *We're currently at a stage where we can do this and we can get the gender guesses for the citing papers' first and last authors, but not for the citing papers' references. All this is currently done in this [script](https://github.com/koudyk/cleanBibImpact/blob/master/src/data/make_dataset.py).*\r\n- [ ] **2. List citing papers' citations**.\r\n- [ ] **3. Guess genders** of the first and last authors of the  citing papers' citations using the [Gender API](https://gender-api.com)\r\n- [ ] **4. Group citations** into one of the following classes, using the gender guesses from the previous step:\r\n  - Man & Man (i.e., man first author & man last author)\r\n  - Woman & Man\r\n  - Man & Woman\r\n  - Woman & Woman\r\n- [ ] **5. Compare class distributions**. Compare the numbers of papers in each class for a) papers that cite the cleanBib code/paper/preprint, versus b) papers that do not. For the papers that do not, we could either use the numbers reported in the paper, or gather similar papers that do not cite the cleanBib code/paper/preprint and run a causal analysis. \r\n\r\n**Good first issues:**\r\n<!-- Add a list of tasks to help new contributors find easy gateways into open source projects. -->\r\n\r\n1. Update our manually collected info on the citation diversity statements of papers citing the cleanBib [code](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3672109)/[paper](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-020-0658-y)/[preprint](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.03.894378). This would involve searching for citing papers on, e.g., Google Scholar, opening the papers, and copy&pasting information into a [spreadsheet](https://github.com/koudyk/cleanBibImpact/blob/master/data/citing_papers__manually_gathered.csv) (DOI, authors, citation diversity statement, etc.)\r\n2. Review our gender-related language in our documentation / presentations to ensure we're discussing these issues in an appropriate way. \r\n\r\n**Skills:**\r\n<!-- Add a list of skills needed to contribute to this project. Try to think of both coding and non-coding skills. You can provide predefined skill levels, but it\u2019s better if you give concrete examples of the type of task contributors will be facing. Please make sure you create equal opportunities to accommodate the newcomers in your project to learn from each other and share the experiences. -->\r\nTechy skills that would be helpful (but not necessary)\r\n- Familiarity with APIs that can be used to automatically gather info about papers (e.g., the [NCBI's Entrez Programming Utilities](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK25497/), [Crossref](https://www.crossref.org/education/retrieve-metadata/rest-api/))\r\n- Python skills: interacting with APIs, packaging, testing, continuous integration\r\n- Git/GitHub: commit, push, branch, pull request\r\n\r\nNon-techy skills\r\n- Using Google Scholar, manually searching papers to find diversity statements and other information, and copy&pasting info into a spreadsheet\r\n- Familiarity with gender theory, to help us discuss our project using sensitive/accurate language\r\n- Familiarity with causal analyses\r\n\r\n**Tools/Software/Methods to Use:**\r\n<!-- Add a list of tools/software/methods that are advised to be installed/reviewed ahead of the event to gain a bit of time with the installation of the software, preparation of the environments or describing the methods that will be needed to contribute to this project.
