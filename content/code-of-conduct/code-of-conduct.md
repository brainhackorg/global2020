# BRAINHACK CODE OF CONDUCT

Brainhack is dedicated to providing a harassment-free Brainhack experience for all of its participants, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion, or other identities. We do not tolerate harassment of event participants in any form.

Everyone violating the Code of Conduct rules that follow may be sanctioned or expelled from the event without a refund, regardless of their stature within the organization.

This Code of Conduct applies to all of this community's spaces, including public channels, private channels, and direct messages, both online and offline. 

Please do not forget that you are responsible to follow the rules listed here, as well as making sure that everyone in the meeting does so as well. Please take the responsibility to be an advocate of establishing and maintaining an inclusive culture within our community. 


## Diversity Statement

We encourage everyone to participate and are committed to building a community for all. Although we will fail at times, as a community we aim to treat everyone both as fairly and equally as possible. Whenever a participant has made a mistake, we expect them to take responsibility for it. If someone has been harmed or offended, it is important to apologize to those affected by our mistakes. By listening carefully and respectfully, and doing our best to right the wrong, one is expected to learn from the experience. We all come from many cultures and backgrounds. We, therefore, expect everyone to be very respectful of different cultural practices, attitudes, and beliefs. This includes being aware of preferred titles and pronouns, as well as using a respectful tone of voice. While we do not assume participants know the cultural practices of every ethnic and cultural group, we expect members to recognize and respect differences within our community. This means being open to learning from and educating others, as well as educating yourself.

Although this list cannot be exhaustive, we explicitly honor diversity in age, gender, gender identity or expression, culture, ethnicity, language, national origin, political beliefs, profession, race, religion, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and technical ability. We will not tolerate discrimination based on any of the protected characteristics above, including participants with disabilities.


## General Rules 

We aim to create a discussion platform that welcomes individuals with diverse backgrounds to interact with each other in a positive environment. We encourage the following behaviors that can help to create such an environment: 



*   Being a respectful listener (not taking up more than your fair share of space);
*   Being respectful to other viewpoints (agreeing respectfully, asking questions to understand differing viewpoints);
*   Be direct but professional; we cannot withhold hard truths.;
*   Using and encouraging the use of welcoming and inclusive language (using “I” statements to indicate that something is how _you_ feel/think, not how everyone does);
*   Giving time to others to think and complete their viewpoints (not jumping in / over other people when they are speaking);
*   Showing support to make everyone feel included and welcomed to the discussions independent of the level of knowledge (giving younger professionals space to speak) 
*   Appreciate and accommodate our many cultural practices, attitudes, and beliefs.
*   Be open to learning from others.
*   Lead by example and match your actions with your words.

### **_Microaggressions_**

Incidents can take the form of “microaggressions,” which is a damaging form of harassment. Microaggressions are the everyday slights or insults which communicate negative messages to target individuals, often based upon their marginalized group membership. Over time, microaggressions can take a great toll on mental and emotional health, and the target’s feeling of belonging in science and academia. The following examples can all be labeled micro-aggressions:



*   Commenting on a woman’s appearance rather than her work;
*   Only directing questions at male colleagues when there are female experts in the room;
*   Telling someone of color that they “speak such good English”;
*   Forcefully praising meat to an individual with a vegetarian diet;
*   Praising alcoholic drinks to an individual who does not consume them;
*   Exclusion from a group can be a common nonverbal form of microaggression;
*   Microaggressions can be couched in the form of a “compliment,” (e.g. “you’re too attractive to be a scientist”).


## Enforcement Responsibilities

Local event organizers are responsible for having a dedicated Code of Conduct Committee to address and investigate the violations of the Code of Conduct throughout the event. The Code of Conduct Committee takes concerns about harassment seriously and is in charge of clarifying and enforcing the standards of acceptable behaviour listed in this Code of Conduct and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behaviour that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful. They are there for you to discuss the problem and will figure out what steps to take next. They may take action to redress anything designed to, or with the clear impact of, disrupting the event or making the environment hostile for any participants. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. Organizers and presenters are similarly subject to the rules in the Code of Conduct.

In all cases, the local organizers will make every effort to stay in clear communication with anyone who reports a problem, maintaining confidentiality.If the complaint originates from a member of the response team, it will be handled by a different member of the response team. If the complaint is about an event organizer, you can use the procedure described below to ensure that the Brainhack Global Code of Conduct Committee will follow up with the reporter.

{{% callout success %}}
[Given that the Brainhack community is global and rules might differ depending on which country/state the events are held (if it is a physical event but might not be applicable in the case of virtual events), be aware that the reporting procedure may change from local event to local event. The reporting procedure for each local event must be found on their dedicated website. You can make a report either personally or anonymously using the reporting mechanism indicated in the website of the local organization without any concerns about situations of any size and magnitude. The reporting procedure below describes how you can report issues regarding organizers or the Brainhack Global team.]

### Reporting procedure

If you are being harassed or made uncomfortable, if you notice that anyone in the gathering is being harassed, or if you feel any other concerns regarding any disruptive and unacceptable behavior of the others regarding the composure of the gathering please follow one of the options below. 

**1. Recommended option: Report the incident to the Code of Conduct Committee.** 

If the complaint is related to an event organizer or the Brainhack Global team, you can fill directly the form available here. You can also make a report either with your personal email or using an anonymous email to [brainhackorg@gmail.com](mailto:brainhackorg@gmail.com) if you prefer.

The Code of Conduct committee is obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter and the incident itself. All reports will be handled with discretion. In your report please include:

*   Your contact information, if you are comfortable providing it.
*   Names (real, nicknames, or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved. If there are additional witnesses, please include them as well.
*   Your account of what occurred, and if you believe the incident is ongoing.
*   If there is a publicly available record (e.g. a mailing list archive), please include a link.
*   Any additional information that may be helpful. 

After filing a report, the Code of Conduct Committee will contact you personally, review the incident, follow up with any additional questions, and make a decision as to how to respond (e.g., talk to the offender, ban the offender from the current and future Brainhack events, connect the reporter to services) and act accordingly.

If you experience a time lapse between your informing and the response and still feel uncomfortable with the situation, please put your personal safety and well-being first. Consider logging out and be persistent on getting a reply and help from the Code of Conduct committee. 

**2. Address it directly: **For smaller incidents that might be settled with a brief conversation, you can choose to direct messaging to the person in question or set up a video chat to discuss how it affected you. Please use this approach only if you feel comfortable; you do not have to carry the weight of addressing these issues yourself. If you’re interested in this option but unsure how to go about it, try discussing with the Code of Conduct Committee first—they will have advice on how to make the conversation happen and can also join you in a conversation.


## Enforcement Process

Brainhack organizers may take action to redress anything designed to, or with the clear impact of, disrupting the event or making the environment hostile for any participants. In the case of a reporting of the violation of the Code of Conduct, the organizers will discuss the actions to be taken immediately. Whatever the resolution that they decide upon, the decision of the admins involved in a violation case will be considered final and which will be shared with the offender privately. 

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, everyone has the responsibility to remind this individual about the Code of Conduct and warn them that repeated inappropriate, uncivil, threatening, offensive, or harmful behavior may lead to a temporary or permanent ban from the event. Anyone who violates this Code of Conduct may be sanctioned or expelled from these spaces at the discretion of the administrators.

The Code of Conduct committee will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse. At the Committee’s and reporter’s discretion, they may publicly name a person about whom they've received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about them, if they believe that doing so will increase the safety of our members or the general public. They will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent. Anyone who receives information during an investigation, however, must maintain its confidentiality; failure to do so is a serious violation of this policy, as is retaliation against any identified individual target, witness, or anyone who raises or helps resolve a conduct concern.
