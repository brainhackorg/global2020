  "project_description": "abels\r\nThere are many strategies that have been proposed in the literature to denoise fMRI time series, and [fMRIprep](https://fmriprep.org/en/stable/) implements many of them. However, the data generated by fMRIprep is *minimally preprocess* and the user is left combining some *confound* variables of their choice to finalize *fully preprocessed* time series. There is [detailed documentation](https://fmriprep.org/en/stable/outputs.html#confounds) in fMRIprep about what these confounds are, but users are left to (1) select a denoising strategy; (2) select the relevant confounds and regress them out. This project aims at contributing to two software libraries aimed at easy denoising either using the nilearn library (with [load_confounds](https://github.com/SIMEXP/load_confounds)), or from the command line (with [nii-masker](https://github.com/danjgale/nii-masker)).
