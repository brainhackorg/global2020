  "project_description": " \r\n*The goal of our project is to investigate novel approaches to assess repeatability and reproducibility in MRI research. As \u2018open science\u2019 becomes integral practice, demonstrating that our MRI measurements are reliable is now easier due to publicly shared datasets. Previous demonstrations of reliability often focus on standard \u2018tried and tested\u2019 statistical measures to report repeatability such as intra-class correlation (ICC) coefficient and coefficients of variation (CV). Additionally, metric maps derived from different MRI sequences are often projected onto whole brain skeletons or masks derived from white matter pathways virtually dissected with diffusion tractography.\r\nWe plan to challenge previous standard approaches by investigating new ways to measure repeatability, by its variability in tractograms beyond volumetric masks and in microstructural measures mapped onto tractograms*.\r\n\r\n**A short example may be:**\r\n\r\n*- Use of different tract properties (e.g. end-points, size, streamline number) to estimate repeatability*\r\n*- Investigating additional strategies (e.g. extra steps that may be critical such as a specific registration step, or data clean up step) that may improve statistical estimation of repeatability*\r\n\r\n*We plan to use the MICRA dataset for this project. The Microstructural Image Compilation with Repeated Acquisitions (MICRA) dataset includes raw data and computed microstructure maps derived from multi-shell and multi-direction encoded diffusion, multi-component relaxometry and quantitative magnetisation transfer acquisition protocols in 6 healthy humans collected at 5 time points. For this project we are also making available tractography results. Access here\r\nhttps://osf.io/z3mkn/*\r\n\r\n*The end result of this collaboration will be to produce and/or evaluate novel reliable methods for the quantification of reliability and reproducibility in tractography/microstructural MRI.*\r\n\r\n\r\n*It is intended to pave the way towards a consensus opinion clarifying the concepts of reliability and reproducibility,  evaluating on how best to approach the assessment of these qualities in future work and  establishing the minimum requirements for their reporting.*\r\n\r\n**Data to use:** *The Microstructural Image Compilation with Repeated Acquisitions (MICRA) dataset includes raw data and processed microstructure maps derived from multi-shell and multi-direction encoded diffusion, multi-component relaxometry and quantitative magnetisation transfer acquisition protocols.
