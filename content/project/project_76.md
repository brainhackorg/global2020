The workflow from project to publication is entirely based on GitHub and completely open and transparent. We have implemented a first complete workflow \\\u00f6/ and are looking for 2 types of community interactions now:  \r\n**(1) Some hacking projects around the platform.**    \r\n*For the Latex experts with love for design* :) During Brainhack, would you like to join us for a little hacking session to improve the visual design of our latex template underlying the final paper pdf? While users only need to work with markdown language, the magic behind the pdf is currently latex. If you feel you could give us a hand, please come join our team.  \r\n*For the Javascript lovers with interest in GitHub actions* :) While we have a first workflow set up, it would be amazing to check that the web template is working, and Github actions compile the forked papers, that links are maintaining the correct targets throughout the process, and that the svg and banner scale across all pages.\r\n**(2) Some first submission tests**\r\nBrainhack proceedings is in its experimental phase. The first complete workflow is ready to be used and tested by all the amazing project outcomes from Brainhack Global: We invite everyone who would like to publish some original work coming out of the Brainhack, to come and test our workflow. Which will be the first publication featuring on the Journal website? \ud83d\ude03 \r\nCome and fork our template repo, fill your content, formulas and figures into the `report.md` file and see it magically transform into a paper preview.
