What is the difference between global and local event sites?\nBrainhack Global (BHG) is an umbrella term for all the hacking events run all around the world and for the central organizing committee which coordinates and helps in the planning and organization of the local events all around the world. Brainhack Global is constituted by a volunteer team of researchers from a variety of research institutions. The team is in charge of designing the proceedings of Brainhack Global as well as maintaining the Brainhack Global materials, websites, and social accounts. Brainhack Global does not run a separate hacking event at any specific location or time but shares the information, materials, and broadcasts from all local event sites during the defined event period.\nLocal event sites refer to the local Brainhack events, where a group of researchers from local institutes comes together and runs hacking events for any period of time. These local events are entirely independent in designing their program and event schedule, tutorial materials, recruiting their attendees and speakers, and finding their funding and venues. The events might include educational tutorials, unconferences, hacking, and social events. The Brainhack Global team helps the local event sites by providing them with all the necessary guidelines and tools that would facilitate the organization of the local event sites and also helps them with the announcement of their event all around the world via its website and social accounts.\nIs Brainhack Global run by an institute / company / individuals?\nBrainhack Global is a series of hacking events that aims to celebrate the application of open science practices in neuroscience research. At the same time, it seeks to foster collaboration among researchers from a variety of career levels and backgrounds. Brainhack Global provides a collective and collaborative unique frame that includes hacking, educational tutorials, unconference events, and networking opportunities between the attendees and event sites. The organization is run voluntarily by a team of individuals (usually graduate students, post-docs, researchers, and professors) that are involved in research in neurosciences at various institutions all around the world.\nMay I be involved with the Brainhack Global team?\nAny help you would like to offer is more than welcome! You may be part of Brainhack Global by either joining the Brainhack Global team or by organizing a local event for the upcoming year. Each year, the Brainhack Global team announces to collect interests for the volunteering teams via its own Mattermost channel or via email lists. If you would like to help out, please look out for those announcements and contact us.\nIs there a limit on the number of local events held each year?\nNo. We support and encourage as much participation as possible from all around the world to celebrate and disseminate the open science processes and practices.\nIs there any funding available by Brainhack Global to the local event sites or attendees?\nBrainhack Global is a voluntarily run organization, which is not funded or supported by any global/local agency, company, or institute. Therefore, Brainhack Global does not have any resources to support either the hosting event sites or the attendees financially. It is the responsibility of the hosting event sites’ local organizing committee to secure funding both for hosting the event and, if possible, for providing travel awards to a select few attendees.\nHow can we contact the Brainhack Global team?\nPlease send an email to brainhackorg@gmail.com with a brief description of your event’s plan, including details about the contact point(s)/organizer(s) (i.e., their email(s) and affiliation lab(s)/institution(s)), the event location (city, country, event site/institute), the event dates, the event website (if available), the number of attendees you plan to host, and whether you will broadcast any tutorials. As soon as the team receives your email, you will be provided with a welcoming pack that includes all the necessary guidance and information for you to start planning the event. Where can I see the previous years’ events?\nHere you can find all the previous years’ event sites, contact points, and the link to their websites.\nWhere can I see the current event locations?\nHere you can find updated information about all the confirmed event sites for a this year’s Brainhack Global event.\nHow can I watch online streaming tutorials?\nHere you can find a schedule of all the local event sites and access their broadcasts in the proposed program. May I use the logo of Brainhack Global in my presentations/materials? Where can I find the logo?\nYes, you can use the Brainhack logo in your presentations and materials. When you use educational and informational materials, please do not forget to cite the materials’ community/developer(s). Here you can download the logo and other materials of Brainhack Global.\nWhat are the main social accounts of Brainhack Global?\n Website: http://www.brainhack.org/global2019 Twitter: https://twitter.com/brainhackorg?lang=en-gb Mattermost: #brainhack-global-2019 Github: https://github.com/brainhack101   ","date":1599609600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1600872361,"objectID":"79dbfa1bccfc8d65473aeb22904ab8ba","permalink":"/faq/general/","publishdate":"2020-09-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/faq/general/","section":"faq","summary":"nice try","tags":null,"title":"Section 1 - General FAQ","type":"book"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"\n\n\n","date":1599609600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1600872361,"objectID":"0492b9e405a42924389ce378ff0eabea","permalink":"/faq/hosts/","publishdate":"2020-09-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/faq/hosts/","section":"faq","summary":"nice try","tags":null,"title":"Section 2 - How to set up your virtual setup","type":"book"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":" We could display the info here\u0026hellip;\nChange video button for Streaming?\n  ","date":1605445200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1600872361,"objectID":"7223fe5521bb7d949254491c9511670c","permalink":"/events/donostia-copy/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/events/donostia-copy/","section":"events","summary":"The most amazing BrainHack you'll ever attend.","tags":[],"title":"BrainHack Donostia","type":"events"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":" We could display the info here\u0026hellip;\nChange video button for Streaming?\n  ","date":1605445200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1600872361,"objectID":"41240f884bdcf0759c2d9a5cb2ff7a63","permalink":"/events/donostia/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/events/donostia/","section":"events","summary":"The most amazing BrainHack you'll ever attend.","tags":[],"title":"BrainHack Donostia","type":"events"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Academic  Academic | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click  PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)   Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \n A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/media/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}   Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }   Questions?
