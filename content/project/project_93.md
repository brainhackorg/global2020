We ask you to include at least one non-coding skill. Use the issue labels for this purpose.\r\n- [x] Chat channel: A link to a chat channel that will be used during the Brainhack Global 2020 event. This can be an existing channel or a new one. We recommend using the [Brainhack space on Mattermost](https://mattermost.brainhack.org/).\r\n\r\nWe would like to think about how you will credit and onboard new members to your project. If you\u2019d like to share your thoughts with future project participants, you can include information about:\r\n\r\n- [x] Specify how you will acknowledge contributions (e.g. listing members on a contributing page).\r\n\r\n**Contributions:**\r\nAll contributions will be recognized in the cookbook and follow the [all-contributors](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/emoji-key) specification.
