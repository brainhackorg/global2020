  "project_description": "\r\nBioImage Suite Web ([BISWeb](https://bioimagesuiteweb.github.io/webapp/)) is a point-and-click app that runs in any modern web browser without any installation necessary, yet with performance rivaling that of a locally installed software. Furthermore, BISWeb is built with modern features that promote usability, reproducibility, and more transparent data sharing. Current applications include MR and calcium imaging analysis and visualization.\r\n\r\nA couple technical notes: 1) this software can also be used as a desktop app via node, and 2) no servers are used to host user data\u2014instead, all data manipulation takes place on the client computer. One can even navigate to an app module, disconnect from the internet, and begin using the tools.\r\n\r\n[User Documentation\u2014handbook](https://bioimagesuiteweb.github.io/bisweb-manual/)\r\n[User Documentation\u2014videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCizfR_ryJ0E-2uZspjwYtwg)\r\n[Developer Documentation](https://github.com/bioimagesuiteweb/bisweb/blob/master/docs/README.md)\r\n\r\n**Data to use:**\r\nWe encourage you to play around with the software using your own data. As mentioned above, all data remains 100% on the client computer\u2014this software does not use any servers to transfer/hold your data at any point. However, a few images (e.g., MNI T1) are provided by the software for testing (see Help bar on a module page).\r\n\r\n**Link to project repository/sources:**\r\n[Software](https://bioimagesuiteweb.github.io/webapp/)\r\n[Code repository](https://github.com/bioimagesuiteweb/bisweb)\r\n\r\n**Goals for Brainhack Global 2020:**\r\nIn this Brainhack, we're welcoming everybody to play around with the web-based application and give any feedback! Specifically, we're looking for users to go through various steps outlined in the docs (especially for connectivity visualization, preprocessing, and live figures) and:\r\n\r\n1. Give any feedback about what elements of the docs and user interface/experience could be improved (e.g., unclear, clunky, etc.)\r\n2. Tell us about anything you think would be useful to see in this software\r\n\r\nNote: The main focus of this project is on the web-based app; however, if you're fairly comfortable with the command line, we'd also welcome you to download the desktop app with node and try it out!\r\n\r\n**Skills:**\r\nThis project is open to any participant across any level of familiarity with programming and neuroscience. In fact, we value insights from participants who are fairly new to programming and/or neuroscience because we are hoping to provide an application that is as easy to use as possible for users with any background. Thus we're only looking for a willingness to try new/different things and attention to detail.\r\n\r\n**Tools/Software/Methods to Use:**\r\nNo prerequisites (this software is ready-to-go in web)\r\n\r\n**Communication channels:**\r\n[Mattermost channel](https://mattermost.brainhack.org/brainhack/channels/bisweb-discussion)\r\n[Zoom channel](https://zoom.us/j/92513019582?pwd=ZUxKaEZXUTFxNVNZK2xONTlKOTlZdz09)\r\n\r\n**Project labels**\r\n<!-- Please prepend a hashtag (#) to all of the labels that fit your project, then tick the box below to state you did so (either by adding an 'x' between square brackets or by ticking it after submission).
